# NanoJIT Standalone Library for Gunderscript 2

This is a minimal clone of [NanoJit](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Nanojit) with only the required bits for
using the JIT inside of [Gunderscript-2](https://github.com/gundermanc/gunderscript-2/). Accordingly, this build has been
modified and does not correspond to an official NanoJIT build.

This repo is forked from quarnster, credits to him for extracting the library from Mozilla Tamarin engine.
